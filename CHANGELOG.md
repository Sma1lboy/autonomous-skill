# Changelog

All notable changes to autonomous-skill are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added (experimental V2 parallel sprints)
- `scripts/parallel-sprint.py` — V2 parallel sprint orchestrator. Dispatches K workers concurrently in isolated worktrees, waits for all to complete, merges in order serially. First merge conflict aborts the wave and preserves remaining worktrees + branches for inspection. Gated by `experimental.parallel_sprints=true` AND `mode.worktrees=true` — both must be on. Commands: `check`, `run`.
- `experimental.max_parallel_sprints` config key (default 3). Also honored via `AUTONOMOUS_MAX_PARALLEL_SPRINTS` env var and `--max-parallel` CLI flag. Precedence: CLI > env > config > default.
- `tests/test_parallel_sprint.sh` — 27 tests covering gating, directions validation, end-to-end wave (2 sprints dispatched, merged, worktrees cleaned up, branches deleted), max_parallel source precedence.
- `tests/claude` mock extended with `MOCK_CLAUDE_WRITE_SUMMARY=1` — writes a fake `sprint-N-summary.json` and makes real git commits inside the worktree, so parallel-sprint.py's E2E test can exercise the full dispatch→merge flow without a real Claude session.
- Not wired into `autonomous/SKILL.md` yet. The script is usable standalone for hackers who enable the flag manually; conductor-level integration will land in a follow-up once the flow is stable.


### Added (experimental flags + schema)
- `schemas/autonomous-config.schema.json` — JSON Schema (draft-07) documenting every field in `~/.claude/autonomous/config.json` with per-key descriptions. IDEs pick it up via `$schema` for autocomplete.
- `user-config.py init` — write a fully-populated sample config (all sections, defaults, `$schema` reference) at global or project scope. Refuses to overwrite existing configs.
- `experimental` section in config schema with two flags — `vira_worktree` and `parallel_sprints`. Both default to false; setting either on emits a WARNING to stderr on every `check` call. Implementation of these features is tracked for a future PR; the flags themselves are no-ops until then but are documented and persist across restarts.
- `user-config.py check` now emits `WARNING: experimental flags enabled: ...` to stderr when any experimental flag is on. Stdout stays machine-readable (`configured`/`needs-setup`) for bash callers.
- All written configs include `"$schema": "..."` reference so editors can validate + autocomplete.


### Added
- `scripts/user-config.py` — global + project config, replaces scattered env vars as the source of truth for mode toggles. Commands: `check`, `get`, `set`, `setup`, `show`, `paths`. Precedence: env > `<project>/.autonomous/config.json` > `~/.claude/autonomous/config.json` > defaults. Reads legacy `.autonomous/skill-config.json` for back-compat.
- First-time setup in `autonomous/SKILL.md` — when no global config exists, asks once via `AskUserQuestion` for `worktrees`, `careful_hook`, and `scope` (global/project), persists, never asks again.
- `tests/test_user_config.sh` — 38 tests covering precedence, env overrides, legacy migration, validation, malformed-config resilience.
- `scripts/worktree.py` — per-sprint git worktree manager (opt-in via `mode.worktrees`). Creates `.worktrees/sprint-N/` on a dedicated sprint branch, symlinks `.autonomous/` back to the main tree so coordination files stay single-sourced. Commands: `create`, `remove`, `list`, `ensure-gitignore`, `prune`, `path`. Refuses symlinked `.worktrees/` or `.autonomous/` to prevent repo escape; validates branch names via `git check-ref-format`; requires `is_git_repo` before remove.
- `tests/test_worktree.sh` — 65 tests covering CRUD, validation, symlink escape refusal, unregistered-directory remove guard, branch name validation, `.autonomous` symlink write-through, and multi-sprint coexistence.

### Changed
- `scripts/persona.py` — OWNER.md now lives at `~/.claude/autonomous/OWNER.md` (global) by default. Legacy `~/.claude/skills/autonomous-skill/OWNER.md` is migrated on first run. When `persona.scope=project` is set in config, OWNER.md goes to `<project>/.autonomous/OWNER.md` instead.
- `scripts/dispatch.py` — careful-hook toggle now sourced from user-config (`mode.careful_hook`). `AUTONOMOUS_WORKER_CAREFUL` env var still overrides for debugging.
- `scripts/build-sprint-prompt.py` — template resolution chain: project `config.json` → project `skill-config.json` (legacy) → global `config.json` → skill-root `skill-config.json` → default.
- `autonomous/SKILL.md` Dispatch phase — when `mode.worktrees=true` (or `AUTONOMOUS_SPRINT_WORKTREES=1`), each sprint runs in its own worktree instead of flipping the main tree onto the sprint branch. Merge runs first (with `--keep-branch`), then worktree removal, then branch delete — if merge conflicts, worktree and branch are preserved for forensics.
- `scripts/merge-sprint.py` — adds `--keep-branch` flag (skip final `git branch -D`, worktree mode deletes the branch separately after worktree removal). Merge failures now return 1 with the merge aborted cleanly instead of raising.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added
- `/explore-ralph-loop` skill — detects Ralph Loop patterns from conversation history and captures them as reusable skills
- `scripts/register-ralph-loops.sh` — dynamic registration of generated loop skills to `~/.claude/skills/`
- `ralph-loop-skills/` directory for generated loop skills (gitignored, per-user)
- Generated loop skills delegate execution to `/quickdo` with canned directions
